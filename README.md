# Twitter_mining

Twitter is one of the most popular social networking websites in the world.
As of the third quarter of 2015, it has around 307 million active users. Every second, on average, around 6,000 tweets are tweeted, which corresponds to over 350,000 tweets sent per minute, 500 million tweets per day and around 200 billion tweets per year. The large amount of data, so available, can be and has been used for providing a number of services.
